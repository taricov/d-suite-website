# Introduction

Welcome to Lanyard API `v1` documentation. Please keep in mind that this is **_not the official_** documentation for Lanyard. This website (as a whole) was created because Lanyard itself didn't had one. Hopefully, this page will be maintained and become the official documentation.

## API Base

Current API base is `https://api.lanyard.rest/v1`.
